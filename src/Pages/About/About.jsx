        <h1 className="text-3xl text-center">Our History</h1>
        <p className=" max-w-5xl mx-auto text-justify text-lg  bg-gray-50 rounded-xl p-2">
          Communication is a potential power in the society. To exercise this
          means of power in the lives of people for their information,
          entertainment, gratification and development there is a need to reform
          the process of communication to disseminate information in a proper
          perspective. Aiming of a new goal of communication in a changing world
          our young generation should know the techniques of modern
          communication using print and electronic media to interact and gratify
          the society. Through the long visionary view of Dr. Md. Sabur Khan,
          Chairman Board of Trustees of Daffodil International University, he
          could realize that in the coming days, media, communication and
          information would be the most powerful tool and would be the thrust
          sector in the society. He felt the need to introduce the Journalism
          and Mass Communication Department in the university which would be a
          contemporary, critical and applied course of study offering to the
          students to achieve knowledge and skills in respective fields. He
          dreamt that this department would be an ornament of the university.
          The course curriculum would be designed to provide the students with a
          comprehensive grounding in the theories, skills and research skills
          necessary to understand and work in the various electronic and
          communication sectors. In March 2007, Mr. Md. Sbur Khan discussed the
          issue with the then Vice Chancellor Professor Dr. Aminul Islam and
          delegated the responsibility to talk with Dr. Golam Rahman to join the
          newly opened Department in the university. Accordingly, Professor Dr.
          Aminul Islam talked with Dr. Golam Rahman and convinced him to join
          the department as the chairman. Mr. Md. Anowar Habib Kazal, Multimedia
          and Public Relations expert was appointed the Coordinator of The
          Department to assist Prof. Dr. Golam Rahman to develop the department.
          Professor Robaet Ferdous of the Department of Mass Communication and
          Journalism at Dhaka University also joined The Department as part time
          faculty. The Department of Journalism and Mass Communication started
          its journey with only five students in the 2007summer semester. The
          first student admitted to the department was Md. Anisur Rahman who is
          now working in Jamuna Television, second one was Md. Golam Mostafa
          Kiron who is now working in Gazi Television, third one was Hafiz Abdul

          Rahman left for Papua New Guinea to join the Department of Language
          and Communication Studies at The Papua New Guinea University of
          Technology as professor and head for 2008-2011. Before leaving,
          Professor Golam Rahman filled the position of head with Md. Shahid
          Ullah, who had vast experience in teaching and had been working at the
          Department of Communication and Journalism at Chittagong University.
          Gradually the number of enrolled students in The Department began to
          grow. From spring semester 2009, The Department introduced two-year
          MSS programme with only four students and Dr. Sakhawat Ali Khan,
          supernumerary professor of the Department of Mass Communication and
          Journalism from University of Dhaka was appointed as adviser of the
          Department. To provide the students with hands-on training, a Media

          Haque, Mr. Md. Rashedul Hasan, Mr. Syed Mizanur Rahman, Mr. Sheikh
          Mohammad Shafiul Islam and Dr. Towfique E Elahi joined the department.
          Professor Golam Rahman returned from Papua New Guinea and joined the
          Department as adviser and later on he was appointed first as the Dean
          of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences and later as the

          public university. By this time, around one thousand students
          completed BSS and MSS degree from the department who are working in
          different local, national, international print electronic media houses
          and organizations with great fame and honor.
